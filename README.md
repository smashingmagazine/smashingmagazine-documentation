# Smashing Magazine â€“ Documentation Files

## What can you find in here?

In the `/documentation` directory you will find markdown files explaining certain features of Smashing Magazine and how to use them in your editorial- and/or writing-process.

If you want to request a certain type of feature or find lack of documentation regarding markup in articles, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/smashingmagazine/smashingmagazine-documentation/issues) for this repository. I created an [example issue](https://github.com/smashingmagazine/smashingmagazine-documentation/issues/1) for you.

I hope all of this is helpful.
